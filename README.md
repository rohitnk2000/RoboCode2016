# HitBotra


**WHO:** We are high school students at Lynbrook High School studying Introduction to Java.

**WHAT:** The two of us have grouped together to create a robot that can defeat the teacher’s master robot and (hopefully) any other robot it encounters. HitBotra assesses its target in order to defeat a specific robot created by the instructor or win in a melee with many robots on the field.

**WHY:** This was a final project which mandated that we defeated the teacher’s robot. The melee scenario was just an extra implementation to receive extra credit. The project was also amusing for us to make.

**HOW:** We utilized advanced coding we learned by observing robots and code on http://robowiki.net/ and we were able to create a functioning robot with cool and unique features, such as changing colors. We had to optimize the shooting settings as well, since the robot’s HP decrements as it shoots more bullets.

**WHEN and WHERE:** We created this robot in May 2016 at Lynbrook High School.
